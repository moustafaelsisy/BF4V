# Battlefield 4 Vengeance (2014)

## Context

My first completed project: This project was written up over the summer of 2014 by myself in order to create a gamemode for GTA San Andreas: Multi-Player that mimics the gameplay style of the game titles Battlefield 3 and 4. SAMP gamemodes are written in a language called PAWN, which is based on C-syntax. Unfortunately, the convention for writing up SAMP gamemodes is to have all the code in a single gamemode file, with a lot of variables in the global scope. Obviously, this is not best practice, and as a matter of fact, most SAMP gamemode developers are newcomers to software development, just like myself back then. Nonetheless, I still admire the magnitude of work that has went into this project, despite it being one of my very first ones.
